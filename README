# About Cascade Cryptography
An Encryption, Decryption & BlindIndex Search bundle made with PHP.  
The purpose of this package is to help simplify the process of Cryptography using Sodium.  

The Cryptography.php file contains AEAD_XCHACHA20_POLY1305_IETF Encryption and Decryption methods capiable of cryptographically securing and decrypting a range of data types.  

Additionally, the Cryptography class offers methods to hash and salt passwords using the Argon2ID alogorithm.
